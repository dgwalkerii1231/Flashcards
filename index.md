## Danny Walker, CIS-245: Programming Android-Mobile Devices

This is where I would write a brief presentation of my final application project for this course.

Name of app: Math Facts

App description: a straightforward math flashcards application to quiz users on basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Target audience: for kids who need to learn or brush up on thier math facts

Challenges in creating the app:
 - Setting constraints
 - Issues with Android Studio emulator not functioning intermittently

Success in creating the app:
 - Building subtraction and division functions/methods: these methods are essentially the same as the addition and multiplication methods, but submit one of the addends or factors as the answer to be found



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dgwalkerii1231/Flashcards/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
